# Violated by Google

This project aims to list all violations committed by Google all over the globe üåç. While settlements and fines are often presented in an isolated manner, the list provides a complete picture: years of various violations committed by one of the richest companies on the planet.

## Contributing

This list is obviously incomplete, so I warmly welcome your contribution. If you identify any missing fine or settlement, **submit a pull request**.

To add new elements to the list, you need to update [violations.yml](https://github.com/MarcT0K/ViolatedByGoogle/blob/main/data/violations.yml). Be careful, the list is inversely sorted by date.

If you have any feature suggestion, open an issue, and we will discuss it together.
